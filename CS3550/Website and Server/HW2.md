- [x] Phase 2
- [x] Phase 3

I discussed this assignment with:

- No one in-person
- Although I did use resources such as www.w3schools.com, www.stackoverflow.com, and www.geeksforgeeks.org for concepts and ideas on implementation and basic how-to's.

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was learning how to work with flex boxes for formatting and arrangement of elements in HTML.

The hardest thing in this assignment was reworking some jankier elements to align correctly as intended. This meant not using negative margins and whatnot.
