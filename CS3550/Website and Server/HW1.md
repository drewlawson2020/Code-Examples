----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [x] Phase 1
- [x] Phase 2
- [x] Phase 3
- [x] Phase 4

I discussed this assignment with:

- No one in-person
- Although I did use resources such as www.w3schools.com, www.stackoverflow.com, and www.geeksforgeeks.org for concepts and ideas on implementation and basic how-to's.

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to work with tables, and input in order to correctly take in the appropriate data and display/accept it.

The hardest thing in this assignment was learning how to style things, thought I ended up using CSS in some areas to speed up the process.
