# Project description
This project implements a web server used to interact with a database containing player game information for Agario. It can retrieve data for display on the webpage, insert data into the database, and add new tables to the database. The code used to send html commands and the code used to interface with the database are in separate classes.

# Assignment time estimate and actual time
The overall assignment took 8 hours to complete. We estimated it would take 8 hours. This project made up about 5 hours of this. Of this time, most was spent making progress with relatively little time needed for debugging when compared to past assignment.

# Comments to Evaluators:
The create command will throw an exception if the tables already exist in the database. We separated the html sending and database interface portions into separate files after seeing the solution that Prof. de St Germain showed during class.

# Assignment specific topics
This assignment introduced SQL and html. IT allowed us to practice interfacing with a database and building an html webpage with data from a database server.

# Partnership and Branching
The vast majority of the work was done as a pair. Peter made one separate branch in order to separate the SQL database portion of the code into a separate class from the server portion. This branch was merged back into main at commit 7da233ecc8cec600dff7b6108bef07f12d69b5eb.

# Consulted peers
