# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

   This file containsmost of the necessary methods and functions to allow the program to store formulas, strings, and doubles
   into a cell system using a custom nest cell class. The file should be able to successfully store this data, as well
   as verify it to ensure that there are no circular formulas (that is, C1 relies on C2, while C2 relies on C1). Further, it 
   is able to change the contents of existing cells that have already been set by using the name as a key within the cellDictionary.
   This file is also capable of getting the names of all non empty cells. In other words, return all of the keys within the
   dictionary. This file also includes a regex expression method to verify that cell names are valid.
   This assignment has also been recently updated to include the AS5 requirements, including a save and load functionality.
