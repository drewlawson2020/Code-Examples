# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating functions using arithmetic and delegation for variables. It has the ability to
take in formulas, verify them, and then correctly and accurately calculate them out for the user. It can also normalize and validate variables, as well
as assign values to them using the Formula and Evaluate classes. As of this writing, the FormulaEvaluator is effectively deprecated, but 
will be included for now until I am told that it is okay to remove. The Formula class file now contains pretty much all of the necessary functions and classes
to be able to effectively do these tasks.
