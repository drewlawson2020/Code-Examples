# Project description
This project contains an extensions class for C# built-ins. One extension, NextItem,  is for stacks. This method first ensures a stack is not empty before calling Peek to determine if the next item on the stack is an input item. SetCell for dictionaries adds a key-value pair to a dictionary if the key is not already in the dictionary, or updates the value associated with the key if the key is contained in the deictionary.

# Comments to Evaluators:
I am planning to use this project across the future assignments.

# Consulted peers
I have not yet consulted any peers about this project.

The method declaration for the NextItem stack extension is adapted from an announcement by Dr. de St Germain
