# Project description
This project contains tests for the public methods in the Spreadsheet program.

# Assignment time estimate and actual time
I estimated that the assignment would take 10 hours which is what it ended up taking. 6 of those hours were devoted to testing and debugging.

# Comments to Evaluators:
There are a few exceptions in the save and read methods that I was not able to cover with the tests. I tried to be as through as possible elsewhere. 

# Assignment specific topics
I think this is a simple introduction to integration testing because we are combining Formulas and DependencyGraphs and have to make sure that both units function as expected when they interact. This assignment also provided some practice in regression testing because many of the tests for Assignment 4 could be updated and reused.

# Consulted peers
I did not consult anyone for this testing file. I thought that I understood what to do well enough.

# References
There are several tests at the end of the file that are adapted from the grading tests for PS4. One test also uses the file writing method posted on the assignment page.
