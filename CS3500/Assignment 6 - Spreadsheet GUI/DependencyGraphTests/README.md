# Project description
This project contains unit tests for the methods contained in the DependencyGraph class.

# Assignment time estimate and actual time
I estimated that this assignment would take 9 hours. It actually took about 7 hours. Writing tests and debugging took about 3 hours.

# Comments to Evaluators:
I put all of the tests that I added into a separate test class called DependencyGraphTestsAdded to separate them from the provided tests.

# Assignment specific topics
This part of the assignment followed up on Lab 3 as an introduction to unit tests in Visual Studio.

# Consulted peers
I did consult any classmates about this test file. I am recovering from a non-Covid related illness and have not been on campus for the past week.

# References
Besides the assignment page and notes, I did not consulted the following webpages:

The last one was to figure out why none of the tests were being recognized before realizing [TestClass] had to go above the class containing tests.
