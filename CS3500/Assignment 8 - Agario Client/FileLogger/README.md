# File Contents
This project contains the classes needed to provide a custom file logger to objects that require one (CustomFileLogProvider) and to define how lines are added to the file (CustomFileLogger). It also contains an extension class that is used to add date, time, and thread information to logged lines.

# Comments to Evaluators
This logger is the same one that we used for Assignment 7

# Consulted Peers
Outside of Piazza, we did not consult any other peers.

# Partnership
Peter Bruns was the driver and Drew Lawson was the navigator for most of the assignment. The partnership went smoothly, but both of us had difficulties understanding a lot of the assignment. Still, the partnership probably ended up saving time since we could both try to figure out what was wrong.

# Best Team Practices
The partnership went smoothly and likely helped us finish faster than we would have individually. This was a tough assignment to understand, so having a partnership probably helped greatly in that regard. All individual work was done on separate branches and code was reviewed befor ebeing merged back to the main branch.
