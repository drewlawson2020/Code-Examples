Please note that using this code or sharing using this code is against the University of Utah's policies on cheating or plagarism, and can result in academic sanctions, which could lead to failure in the class you use this code in, or expulsion from the university entirely. Trust me, you're better off learning this on your own than copying from me, not worth the trouble.
